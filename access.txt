Access Modifiers:
In cpp classes we can control the access to the memebver of the class using access specifiers also known as access Modifiers

In cpp there are 3 access specifiers that are:
1> public: Memeber declared as public can be accessed from outside the class
2> private: Memeber declared as private can only be accessed within the class itself
3> Protected: Members declared as Protected can be acceses within the class and by derived class
