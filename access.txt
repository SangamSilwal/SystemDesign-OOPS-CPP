Access Modifiers:
In cpp classes we can control the access to the memebver of the class using access specifiers also known as access Modifiers

In cpp there are 3 access specifiers that are:
1> public: Memeber declared as public can be accessed from outside the class
2> private: Memeber declared as private can only be accessed within the class itself
3> Protected: Members declared as Protected can be acceses within the class and by derived class


Static data Memebers:
Static data members are the class memebers that are declared using static keyword
The characteristics of the staic keyword are:
1> Only one copy of that memeber is created throughout the program
2> It is initialized before any object of the class is created 

Note: We cannot initialized the static data member inside the class
due to the class rules and the fact that we cannot assign it a value
using constructor

While initializing we need to use a scope resolution operator "::"
syntax : datatype class_name::var_name = value...;
